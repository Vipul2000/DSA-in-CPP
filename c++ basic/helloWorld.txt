How does the c++ program work?


#include<iostream>   
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
     cout<<"Hello world";
     return 0;
}

-> # is called preprocessor directives, 'iostream' files is known as header files which have some pre-written codes (basics input,output functions)

'using namespace std;' -> standard form of input and output.

'int main()' -> It is a functions which perform a specific task and return 0.

// -> It is called comment in c++.
