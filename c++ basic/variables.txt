-> Variables is like containers wgich is use to store data.
-> Named storage that contain some values.

int apple = 5; here int specifies type of data.


Rules of naming variables in c++
1. Variable nam should not begin with with a number.
2.Whitespaces are not permitted in variable names.
3.A c++ keywprd cannot be used as a variable name
4.while creating variables it's preferable to give them meaningful name.
5.we use all lowercase letters when creating one-word variable name. for variable names with more than one word the first word hasall lowercase letter and first letter of subsequent words capitalised.
